# NYT-Articles-Sentiment
This project explores public discourse by analyzing user comments on New York Times articles using a variety of natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to uncover patterns in sentiment, topic distribution, and engagement across different articles and user interactions.

Key components include:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Parsed and cleaned thousands of NYT user comments to prepare for analysis, including removing stopwords, tokenization, and lemmatization.

Sentiment Analysis: Used machine learning classifiers to predict the sentiment of user comments (positive, negative, or neutral). Applied feature extraction techniques like TF-IDF to transform text data and evaluated model performance using accuracy and confusion matrices.

Topic Modeling: Implemented unsupervised learning (LDA - Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to identify major themes and topics within the comments. Visualized topic distributions and dominant terms for interpretability.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed trends in comment volume, recommendation counts, and article sections to understand reader engagement patterns.
